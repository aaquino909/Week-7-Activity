# Week-7-Activity
A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

When adding trains, this app allows administrators be able to submit the following:

1. Train Name

2. Destination 

3. First Train Time -- in military time

4. Frequency -- in minutes
